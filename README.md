# League Of Locales
 > A robust League of Legends Locale modifier!


This program allows the user to use any language they desire on almost any League of Legends server. Simply run the script and enter the options as prompted. Creates a configuration file with the 
default current and desired language. Then, simply scans for the Riot Games directory and modifies
the 'LeagueClientSettings.yaml' file.
