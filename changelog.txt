Side note: 
I mainly decided to rewrite this project because it's been a hobby project of mine for a
long time and I've learned a whole bunch over the years since. Looking back at it, I kind 
of cringe at how terrible the code was, so I wanted to give it a much needed overhaul.

Anyways, thanks for reading and I sincerely hope you enjoy League of Locales 3!
